        <h1>List of Cryptocurrency Captcha Faucets 2025</h1>
    </header>
<p>In the turbulent seas of cryptocurrency, finding a genuinely robust and future-proof asset can feel like navigating a minefield. As someone who once championed Nano through a bull run, I've grown increasingly disillusioned by the persistent shortcomings and the unwavering, often deluded, optimism of its loyalists. It's a hard truth to swallow when a once-favorite project fails to deliver on its promises. This deep dive isn't to bash Nano gratuitously, but rather to present a candid assessment of its fundamental flaws and, more importantly, to explain why my conviction has shifted dramatically towards Kaspa as the clear successor, addressing every major pain point Nano has failed to resolve.</p>
<h2>Not Decentralized</h2>
<p>Nano operates with only 69 nodes, and its coin distribution is heavily centralized - so centralized that just two major exchanges could control consensus.</p>

<h2>Not Scalable</h2>
<p>While marketed as scalable and feeless, Nano handles only around 300 transactions per second (TPS)—a modest figure given its fee-free model. Its architecture struggles under pressure and has not demonstrated reliable throughput at scale.</p>

<h2>Not Secure</h2>
<p>Nano has a history of congestion during bull runs, with its fee-less structure making it prone to spam and denial-of-service attacks. These recurring issues reduce trust and usability, especially during periods of high demand.</p>

<h2>Not Sustainable</h2>
<p>Nano node operators receive no rewards, unlike miners or stakers in other networks. This lack of economic incentive leads to low participation and reliance on goodwill or donations, weakening long-term sustainability.</p>

<h2>Not Fair Launch</h2>
<p>Nano’s initial distribution involved a CAPTCHA-based faucet system that was widely abused. Significant pre-allocation and poor oversight during its launch phase have raised concerns about fairness and decentralization from the outset.</p>

<h2>No Smart Contracts</h2>
<p>Nano lacks smart contract functionality. There will be no stablecoins, no dapps, limiting its relevance in a modern crypto landscape that increasingly values programmability and composability.</p>

<h2>Low Adoption</h2>
<p>Nano has gained little adoption. Most Tier 1 exchanges are still ignoring it, Binance removed trading pairs, Exodus Wallet removed it entirely.</p>

<h2>Bad Reputation</h2>
<p>Nano has faced major reputational hits: BitGrail hack, rebranding from Raiblocks, and Coinbase lawsuit. These events cast doubt on its credibility and regulatory clarity, potentially deterring institutional support.</p>
