You don't have to worry about watermarks or paying for expensive software, as all of the options mentioned in this article are completely free. In this article, we'll be exploring three main ways to record videos in Windows. Each option has its own set of features and benefits, and we'll provide a detailed rundown of how to use each one. Whether you're a casual user or a professional content creator, these methods will help you create high-quality videos with ease.</p><ul><li>Microsoft Game Bar</li></ul><p>One of the simplest ways to record videos is by using the Microsoft Game Bar. It's a built-in feature on Windows, so you don't have to download any additional software. However, the downside is that it's primarily designed for recording games and may not work with all programs. Nonetheless, it works well with popular browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. To start recording, press the hotkey combination of Win + Alt + R, or press Win + G to open the menu.</p><ul><li>GeForce Experience</li></ul><p>Another option for recording high-quality videos is to use GeForce Experience. However, this option requires an NVIDIA graphics card, and it's recommended to have the latest graphic card driver installed. To activate it, press the Alt + Z hotkey.</p><ul><li>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</li></ul><p>For more advanced users and streamers there is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). It's a open-source software that can be used to record videos as well as stream live content. OBS is highly recommended for those who want to achieve professional-looking recordings. To get started, simply download OBS from <a href="https://obsproject.com">https://obsproject.com</a>.<br /></p><span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/starry-sky-998641/">Image Source</a></span>
